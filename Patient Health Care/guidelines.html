                What Does It Mean to Be “Healthy”
              </h4>
              <p>
                While "healthy" is a term that gets thrown into conversations regularly, its flippant versatility can be confusing. If you search Instagram, you'll find insight into what society collectively considers the healthy ideal: fitness models behind filters, bodybuilders and their supplements, detoxing and fad diet claims, the virtues of “clean-eating,” and an extreme amount of juicing. You get the picture—you’ve probably seen the pictures, too. 
                Researchers pinpoint some major problems with this near-constant imagery. First, media (particularly social media) plays a huge role in shaping what behaviors people consider important to reach a certain goal. But since these behaviors prioritize physical appearance, they’re generally linked with negative psychological effects and poorer physical health outcomes.
                It comes down to this paradox: studies routinely show that someone's body shape is not a good indicator of how healthy they actually are.2 In a world where poor body image is fairly common, it's fair to question whether or not we may be missing the mark on what it means to be healthy.

                Everything You Need to Know About Cholesterol
              </h4>
              <p>
                Cholesterol is a waxy substance that your body needs to build cells and manufacture vitamins and other hormones, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).
                These foods contain dietary cholesterol. But they also tend to be high in saturated and trans fat and trigger the liver to make more cholesterol. Other foods, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil, contain saturated fat that can increase so-called “bad” cholesterol.
                For some people, these foods represent a major source for increasing blood cholesterol. Because the typical Western diet is loaded with these foods, rising cholesterol levels have led the way to an epidemic of health problems linked to high cholesterol, says Trejo Gutierrez, MD, a cardiologist with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.
